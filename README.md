<b>Briefly explanation about Discriminant:</b>

* Discriminant is a part of the quadratic formula underneath the square root symbol e.g b<sup>2</sup>-4*a*c. Discriminant tells us whether there are two solution , one solution or no solution.

<b>Explanation about code:</b>

In this program we take b,a,c as input and find discriminant by using formula. b<sup>2</sup>-4*a*c and store it in new variable called discriminant. then we take square root of discriminant 
so that we could use it to know whether it is a perfect square or no? and after that we store the value into new variable called r. then we use if statement for decision whether it is perfect
square or no.

<b>How to know that the roots will be rational,irrational,equal,unequal,imaginary?</b>

*if discriminant > 0 and it is perfect square, roots will be rational and unequal.
<br>
*if discriminant > 0 but not a perfect square, roots will be irrational and unequal.
<br>
*if discriminant = 0, roots will be equal.
<br>
*if discriminant < 0, roots will be imaginary.
